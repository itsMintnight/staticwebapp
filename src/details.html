		A few notes from Jax's amazing foster family!

		"Our newest foster Jax is available for adoption from Guilford County Animal Shelter!

		A big detail to consider that doesn't define him, but certainly makes him unique is he is completely blind and partly hard of hearing.

		But don't let that write you off! While he needs guidance navigating his walks outdoors, he has quickly learned the lay out of our home and gently finds his way around and loooves to stroll the fenced in back yard where he knows he is safe.

		We have lovingly nicknamed him Roomba!

		Car rides do make him nervous. However, slow gentle back roads with the window rolled down will make him crack a smile and hang that big block head out the window.

		He's estimated to be 10 years old, though I would question being more 12, is a stocky medium build, approximately 60-70 lbs, house trained, sleeps a solid 9 hrs, and doesn't make a peep!

		He loves cuddles and interaction, and loves dogs! I believe he would do great with other dogs in the home that also have more of a laid back quiet lifestyle that can give him guidance and companionship. Being blind, hyper barking dogs that would roughhouse may stress him out as he spends his down time gnawing on a bone and laying on his bed catching a snooze."

		As always, we strongly recommend bringing any resident dogs to the shelter for a meet and greet with potential new family members to be sure it's a good match. If bringing a dog for a meet and greet, please bring proof of up to date rabies, bordetella, and DHPP vaccines. </p>
